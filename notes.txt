- Asteroids can spawn in players

- Multiple players trailinglist for the same asteroid.
- player leave should de-own asteroids

- held check verbeteren ---> asteroids zijn niet pakkable na held == true

- Master client settings (Welke mechanics, lock-on? free aim?)




- HTML5 export?



- Spectator build? -----> screencap?
- Meerdere rooms?
- Link naar google forms

- Asteroids should not rotate with the player, but with the boost


- asteroid belts
- texture packs --> 1,2,3,4 keys -> in-game
- Lock-on system
