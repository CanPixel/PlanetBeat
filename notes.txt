- Asteroids can spawn in players

- Multiple players trailinglist for the same asteroid.
- player leave should de-own asteroids

- held check verbeteren ---> asteroids zijn niet pakkable na held == true
--> if one object is captured, more objects accidentally get "held" because they still collide

- Failed to network-remove GameObject. Client is neither owner nor MasterClient taking over for owner who left: View 2 on ASTEROID

- Master client settings (Welke mechanics, lock-on? free aim?)




- HTML5 export?


- Asteroids zijn vaak op tweede plaats



- Spectator build? -----> screencap?
- Meerdere rooms?
- Link naar google forms

- Asteroids should not rotate with the player, but with the boost


- asteroid belts
- texture packs --> 1,2,3,4 keys -> in-game
- Lock-on system (alleen asteroids)
	--> Max-range, growing speed. Border hits object == Capture
	--> radial trigger grows, closest object gets captured
