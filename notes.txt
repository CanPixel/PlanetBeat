- Multiple players trailinglist for the same asteroid.

- Failed to network-remove GameObject. Client is neither owner nor MasterClient taking over for owner who left: View 2 on ASTEROID

- Lock-on system (alleen asteroids)
	--> Max-range, growing speed. Border hits object == Capture
	--> radial trigger grows, closest object gets captured
